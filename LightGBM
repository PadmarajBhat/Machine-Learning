* What is LightGBM?
   * it is from Microsoft (2017).
   * claims bettern than xgboost
      * it creates bin of the continuous variable and uses it to find the best split.
         * this not only reduces the speed but also addresses the sparsity in the data.
* How is it different from xgboost? or is it better to xgboost ?
    * xgboost with tree method="hist" can be comparable to that of lightGBM.
    * xgboost seems to have low prediction time but high training time when compared to that of lightGBM.
    
    * There is also a catboost (categorical boosting) but that has slow training time but excellent prediction time. : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/catboost-automated-categorical-data/
    * nice article on parameter tuning of LGBM
    
* Open ended question:
    * can xgboost be distributed ?
    * 
    * how does LGBM scale out?
        * single machine with multiple cpu ?
        * single machine with multiple cpu and gpu
        * multiple machines with multiple cpu and gpu
            * **Ans**:
            * Need to dig deep into https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parallel-Learning-Guide.html
            * Bit into theory:
                * data parallelism: data is split horizontally, so as to create bins. best split for the tree growth is taken from the recursive best fit and hence reducing the "reduce" efforts. Best suited for the large data model builiding.
                * feature parallelism: features are distributed among workers who communicate best splits with others. Suitable when features are considerable large. Hope there is a ratio which we determines the kind of parallelism to choose.
            
    * when it comes to catboost performance, how far is LGBM when data has categorical features ?
    
    * should the categorical features to be one hot encoded before being fed to LGBM ?
        * **Ans**:
        * in the traditional approach to create machine learning model, encoding is common practice. However, LGBM does not wants expects the same. However, the categorical columns has to be explicitly specified. : https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-Intro.html
                * ```train_data = lgb.Dataset(data, label=label, feature_name=['c1', 'c2', 'c3'], categorical_feature=['c3'])```
