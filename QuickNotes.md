##### Notes on Machine Learning from various Sources:
* R2 vs Adjusted R2 : https://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/difference-between-r-square-and-adjusted-r-square/264
    * R2 increases if the variables are added
    * adjusted R2 would decrease or remain same if the newly added variable do not impact dependent variable.
    * highly advised to use adjusted R2 when multivariable linear regression is opted.
